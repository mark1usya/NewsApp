NewsApp

NewsApp is a Swift-based application built using the MVVM architecture. It fetches and displays the latest news articles by integrating with a third-party API. The app handles JSON parsing and displays the news content in a clean and user-friendly interface.

Features

 • JSON Parsing: Parses the fetched data and displays it in a structured format.
 
 • MVVM Architecture: Ensures clear separation of concerns and makes the app scalable and maintainable.
 
 • Dynamic UI: Displays the latest news headlines and detailed articles.
 
 • Error Handling: Handles API errors such as network issues or missing data gracefully.
